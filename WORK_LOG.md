| December 3rd  | 8:00pm - 8:45pm  |                                                                                      During this time I read through the slides and the problem set to see what it was about. My interpretation is that I need to create a lossless algorithm that will find and recognize patterns in the English dictionary that can be compressed. In addition, the larger the test case the better compression ratio because they are more data to find more patterns. |
| December 3rd  | 8:45pm - 9:30pm  |             I spent this time learning more about loseless algorithms on Google and how to find patterns in large pieces of texts. I gathered that certain letters are paired / bunched together quite often to form words, so maybe that could be an approach to find a pattern. In addition, if certain words are present before, then another word is quite common to come after that (and that pattern can actually continue for a couple more words). |
| December 3rd  | 9:30pm - 10:00pm | I did more research during this time and confirmed that my idea of matching common letters pairing to a word could actually be correct! In addition, the most common strings and or chars could have the least amounts of bits representing them (to be even more efficient). I also learned that if there are multiple of the same letter in a row, I cam just compress it to be the amount of times its present and that letter (so like CCC can be 3C). |
